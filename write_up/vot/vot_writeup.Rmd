# Model paramaters

dependent variable = vot in ms log10 tranformed
fixed effects = langauge x context x word number
random effects = 1) speaker as a random intercept and as a random slope by language x context x word number unorrelated with the interecept, 2) word as a random intercept and as a random slope by context + word number, 3) sentence as a random intercept

# Overall results
