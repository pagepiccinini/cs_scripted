# Model parameters

dependent variable = stop (0) or fricative (1) realization

fixed effects = context x word number

random effects = 1) speaker as intercept and slope by context + word number uncorrelated with intercept, 2) word as intercept and slope by word number uncorrelated with intercept, 3) sentence as intercept
